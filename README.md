<p>Our project used the camera module of Raspberry PI to take images of certain areas of the forest and check for forest fire in the area.</p>

The main tasks in the project were:<br>

- Capturing images from the location using the USB webcam module of Raspberry-Pi
- Developing a Computer Vision and Machine Learning Model to extract features from the images to predict the existence of fire or smoke.<br>
- Developing a system to notify the authority using message and emails alerts.
